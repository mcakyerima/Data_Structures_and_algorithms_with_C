# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms course! This repository contains code examples and notes for the course, as well as resources for further learning.

## Course Outline

The course is divided into several topics, including:

- Big O notation
- Arrays and Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Binary Trees and Binary Search
- Sorting Algorithms
- Graphs and Graph Algorithms

## Code Examples

I will be using C and JavaScript for our code examples. Each topic will have its own directory containing example code and notes.

## Resources

I recommend the following resources for further learning:

- Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein
- Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript by Michael McMillan
- Data Structures and Algorithms in C by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and David M. Mount
