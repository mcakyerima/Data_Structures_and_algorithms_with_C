# Week 1: Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

## This week's topics include an introduction to data structures and algorithms. We discussed the following:

    - What are data structures and algorithms
    - Why are data structures and algorithms important
    - Time and space complexity
    - Big O notation

## Time and Space Complexity

Understanding time and space complexity is essential in designing efficient algorithms. We learned that time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run based on the size of the input, while space complexity refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm.

We also learned about Big O notation, which is used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity. Big O notation allows us to compare the efficiency of different algorithms and determine which one is better for a specific problem.
